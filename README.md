> Power loss during flash can brick the device.
> Keep backups of important MTD partitions before flash

## Installation

Download the three required files from latest release https://github.com/majad00/zyxel-ex5601-openwrt-to-OEM-converter/releases/tag/1.1

- `loader.sh`
- `openwrt_restore_bundle.tar.gz`
- `restore_bundle_ex5601.tar.gz`
```sh
  wget https://github.com/majad00/zyxel-ex5601-openwrt-to-OEM-converter/releases/download/1.1/{loader.sh,openwrt_restore_bundle.tar.gz,restore_bundle_ex5601.tar.gz}
```

Copy these two files to the router under `/tmp`:

- `loader.sh`
- `openwrt_restore_bundle.tar.gz`

Example:

```sh
scp loader.sh openwrt_restore_bundle.tar.gz root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/
```

SSH into the router and run:
```sh
cd /tmp
chmod +x loader.sh
./loader.sh
```

After the loader finishes, open LuCI and go to:
System > Matrix Installer
> Stage 2 will not start if you are not on Openwrt ubootmod layout


Upload this file from your computer when asked:

restore_bundle_ex5601.tar.gz

After the bundle is verified, choose the conversion option you want. (See screenshot below)
